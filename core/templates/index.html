  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p class="info">
    Hi, I'm Jason Luo (SharpBit), the creator of this website. I'm a student studying Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
    Originally, I created this website to learn more about web development.
    If you're interested, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/SharpBit/webserver" target="_blank">here</a>.
    My most popular project is <a href="https://github.com/SharpBit/brawlstats" target="_blank">brawlstats</a>, an API wrapper written in Python for the Brawl Stars API.
    You can view all of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/SharpBit" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.
    If you want to learn Python, I compiled a list of <a href="/learnpython" target="_blank">useful resources</a> to learn Python.

  <h4>What can I do on this website?</h4>
  <p class="this-website">
    You can navigate the website by using the navigation bar at the top. It has the ability to shorten URLs and save code in pastebins.
    You can also log in using Discord before doing that to view all your shortened URLs and pastebins under your dashboard!
    I'm currently working on a website to practice random Japanese verb and adjective inflections, as well as an option to handwrite your answer, so look out for that!
